CS Questions with Automated Tests (General, Strings, Sorting Algorithms, Trees, Data Structures, Linked Lists)

## Scripts

```text
npm test
```

## TO-DO

### Sorting

- [ ] Implement merge sort
- [ ] Implement quick sort

### Linked Lists

- [ ] Implement a linked list (with insert and delete functions)
- [ ] Find the Nth element in a linked list
- [ ] Remove the Nth element of a linked list
- [ ] Check if a linked list has cycles
- [ ] Given a circular linked list, find the node at the beginning of the loop. Example: A-->B-->C --> D-->E -->C, C is the node that begins the loop
- [ ] Check whether a link list is a palindrome
- [ ] Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively

### Strings

- [ ] Find the first non-repeated character in a String
- [ ] Reverse a String iteratively and recursively
- [ ] Determine if 2 Strings are anagrams
- [ ] Check if String is a palindrome
- [ ] Check if a String is composed of all unique characters
- [ ] Determine if a String is an int or a double
- [ ] HARD: Find the shortest palindrome in a String
- [ ] HARD: Print all permutations of a String
- [ ] HARD: Given a single-line text String and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right

### DatStructures

- [ ] Implement a stack with push and pop functions
- [ ] Implement a queue with queue and dequeue functions
- [ ] Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time
- [ ] Write a function that sorts a stack (bonus: sort the stack in place without extra memory)
- [ ] Implement a binary min heap. Turn it into a binary max heap
- [ ] HARD: Implement a queue using 2 stacks

### General

- [ ] Write fibbonaci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)
- [ ] Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers
- [ ] Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})
- [ ] Use dynamic programming to find the first X prime numbers
- [ ] Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int
- [ ] Implement parseInt
- [ ] Implement squareroot function
- [ ] Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)
- [ ] Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using \*
- [ ] HARD: Given a function rand5() that returns a random int between 0 and 5, implement rand7()
- [ ] HARD: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s) function
- [ ] Given 2 integer arrays, determine if the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array. Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}
